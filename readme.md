# Linux Hardening Automation Project
## project start date: 2024/11/08
The initial scope of this project is to create a method to easily and quickly deploy Secuirty Hardened Debian virtal machines, via a series of automation and scripting tools. then to covert those machines to easily and rapidly deployable OVA images which can act as a Secure golden image. - Origionaly this was going to be for Ubuntu but at this stage I am unable to successfully get a ubuntu VM working in my environment due to CPU architecture - this may change.
